# Workflow — delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The task lifecycle

A task SHALL travel: open → claimed (in_progress, set by `sindri-worker issue next` via
`td start`) → submitted (in_review with a PR, set by `sindri-worker submit` via `td
review`) → merged (task closed, by action-merge) or rejected (task back to open,
by action-reject). A claimed task left over from a crashed run SHALL be reset on
the next `sindri-worker issue next`. A merge that cannot be applied because the
branch conflicts with the advanced base SHALL return the work to its owning worker
— as a rejection does — rather than landing or failing silently.

#### Scenario: Happy path

- **WHEN** a worker implements an open task and submits it, and a human approves
  and merges
- **THEN** the PR lands on the base branch and the task is closed

#### Scenario: Rework path

- **WHEN** a submitted task is rejected with feedback
- **THEN** it returns to open and `sindri-worker issue next` surfaces it again with the
  rejection comment

#### Scenario: Orphan recovery

- **WHEN** `sindri-worker issue next` runs with a stale in_progress task from a prior run
- **THEN** that task is unstarted before a new one is claimed

#### Scenario: Merge conflict returns to the worker

- **WHEN** merging an approved PR cannot apply because its branch conflicts with
  the current base
- **THEN** the work is routed back to the owning worker to rebase and resubmit,
  just as a rejection would, with the conflict reported
