## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Per-task branches in worktrees

Each task SHALL be developed on its own branch named for the task, in an
isolated git worktree. A worktree SHALL never check out a branch already in use
by another worktree; the shared base branch is used via detached HEAD.

#### Scenario: Picking up a task

- **WHEN** an agent starts a task
- **THEN** it works on a branch named for that task's id (`sd-……`, or `td-……` for a task
  minted before that prefix), created from the base in its own worktree

#### Scenario: Base branch in use

- **WHEN** a worktree needs the base branch that the main repo already checks out
- **THEN** it uses a detached HEAD at the base tip rather than checking out the branch
